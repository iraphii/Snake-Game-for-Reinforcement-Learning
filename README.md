# Snake-Game-for-Reinforcement-Learning
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Python using the Pygame library. It is designed to be used for training a neural network with reinforcement learning.

# Dependencies
To run this game, you will need Python 3 and Pygame library installed. You can install Pygame via pip by running the following command:
pip install pygame

# Running the Game
To run the game, simply execute the snake.py script in a Python environment.
python3 snake.py

# Game Controls
Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without running into the walls or the snake's body.

# Reinforcement Learning
To use this game for reinforcement learning, you can modify the game() function to implement your own reinforcement learning algorithm. The current implementation simply keeps track of the highest score achieved and starts a new game when the current game ends.

Happy coding and have fun playing!
